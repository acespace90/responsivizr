# RESPONSIVIZR

Responsivizr is a visual tool to show how responsive images behave across viewports in RWD.

Through a graphic visualization of the image continuum, it helps you choose the most effective image sizes and provides the HTML snippets to integrate into your code.

You can play with it here: http://responsivizr.com
